## Introduction

* Admin UI for managing galleries and reordering images
* Gallery snippets for manual placement inside CMS and [static](https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-pages) pages
* Link one or more galleries to a [blog post](https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-blog)
* Form widget for use in custom layouts
* Automatic image resizing using [ImageResizer](https://octobercms.com/plugin/toughdeveloper-imageresizer) if it is installed.

This plugin is largely based on [SimpleGallery by PolloZen](https://octobercms.com/plugin/pollozen-simplegallery).

This plugin does NOT include any CSS or Javascript, leaving any styling and animation up to the developer. The plugin renders clean unordered lists unless overriden.

## Display a gallery 

### For CMS pages

Drop the `Gallery` component into your page. Edit the `Select the gallery` option, if you want to display a specific gallery.

If you you want to load a dynamic gallery depending the on the url, specify the `Gallery slug` and leave `Select the gallery` set to the default `Using gallery slug`. For example, creating a CMS page with the URL `/gallery/:slug` and including the `Gallery` component with the slug `Gallery slug` set to `:slug` will display the `Test` gallery when visiting the url `/gallery/test`.

### For static pages

Drop the `Gallery` snippet into your static page.  Edit the `Select the gallery` option to choose the gallery to display. Ignore the `Gallery slug` option.

### For static pages as a custom data type (Form Widget)

Include a custom field in a static page layout as follows:

    {variable name="galleryId" label="Gallery" tab="Gallery" type="gallery" placement="primary"}{/variable}

This will render a gallery picker when this layout is used by the user. The variable can then be passed on to render the actual gallery. (See CMS pages above)

### For blog posts

Blog posts can be linked up with one or more galleries on the `Galleries` tab when creating or editing a blog post. Information about connected galleries can then be accessed though the `post.gallery` variable inside your page.

## Image Resizing

When the `Max Dimension` property is used for the `Gallery`  component, all gallery images will be resized using October's [Resizer](https://docs.octobercms.com/3.x/extend/services/resizer.html) so that the longest side is that length in pixels. The default is `0`, which means that original images will be used.

<a name="overriding-component-template"></a>
## Overriding the Component Template

You can expand and edit the component templates if a different resizing logic is needed (for example with more options) or if you want to use your own markup.  Right click on the `{% component %}` tag and click `Expand Component Partial`. (Also see [Customizing Default Markup](https://docs.octobercms.com/3.x/cms/themes/components.html#customizing-default-markup))
